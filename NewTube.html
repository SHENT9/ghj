        <div class="tewhat">
            <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 
            1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to 
            make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but 
            also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
            It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
            Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
            PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</div>

        <h3 class="why">Why do we use it?</h3>
            <div class="tewhy">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by 
                the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using 
                Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, 
                as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable
                 English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum
                  as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web 
                  sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, 
                  sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like)
